## Realtime Anomaly Detection Using Cloud Stream Analytics and Vertex AI.

# Background
Due to the increasing threats and attacks on network infrastructure, it has become essential for companies to closely monitor the traffic flowing through their network systems. This monitoring allows them to promptly identify unusual network activity, often caused by malicious actors. This project addresses this concern by developing a solution that continuously monitors network traffic in nearly real-time and triggers alerts whenever any abnormal behavior is detected.
